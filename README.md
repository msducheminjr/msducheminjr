# Mike Duchemin
Improvement and innovation are like breathing to me. I am never content with the status quo. I have dedicated my career to learning new skills that make me better at what I do so I can find new ways to solve problems with business process and technology improvements and empower others to do likewise.

## About my repos
My portfolio is spread across two places.
### Personal account repos
The repos associated with my account [msducheminjr](https://github.com/msducheminjr) are primarily learning projects (I open-source my learning as much as possible) or contributions to other projects.

Most of my serious open source work takes place in the [Stateless Code](https://github.com/statelesscode) organization. I'm a "fuzzy techie" with a liberal arts background who learned how to program in the wild to solve business problems. I want to help other people learn to code by trying to provide the resources I wish I had. All of the work done with Stateless Code is available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/statelesscode). There are hundreds of free videos with more being added all the time.

I geek out over Simon Sinek's Start With Why, Clifton Strengthsfider, and many other things. 

Myers-Briggs Type Inidicator: **INFP** I'm a True North type of person who is more concerned with the Why and the vision. I typically use my "gut" to make decisions.

Enneagram: 5. I know hardly anything about it, but that's what I get on tests.
